                    offerings for anyone looking to hire using SHENZYN’s platform.</p>
      <p>The Products of SHENZYN are broadly categorised in two parts: (a) SmartScreen (an online access
          product) available for employer(s)/ recruiter(s)/consultant(s) and such other third parties, and (b)
          SmartHire.
          Under SmartScreen, the employer(s)/ recruiter(s)/consultant(s) and such other third parties, can
          post job(s) and set the required custom screening criteria. SHENZYN’s matching algorithms will
          instantly share profiles that match the requirement of employer(s)/ recruiter(s)/consultant(s) and
          such other third parties. The said profiles are sourced from profiles uploaded by the user (being
          the Client) itself, profiles uploaded and shared by other users and profiles owned by SHENZYN. If
          the user wants access to contact details for a profile owned by SHENZYN or for a profile uploaded
                    and shared by other users, the said user shall have to pay and unlock the required profile.</p>
      <p>Under SmartHire, the employer(s) share their requirement with SHENZYN instead of managing multiple
          consultant(s). SHENZYN will share the requirement with its network of consultant(s), making sure
          that consultant(s) are sharing the right kind of profiles. SHENZYN will be invoicing the employer(s)
          on every success and in consideration of consultant(s) business development efforts, the
                    consultant(s) will receive payment/revenue share from SHENZYN for every success.</p>

      <p>To enable the SmartScreen and SmartHire plans, there are certain actions that an
                    employer/consultant/recruiter can take on SHENZYN’s platform, these include:</p>

      <p><b>1</b> Upload profile data in the form of CVs or excel</p>
      <p> A profile can be uploaded either in ‘private’ mode or ‘shared’ mode. If a profile is uploaded as a
          private profile, only the owner of the profile/Client will have access to the profile information.
          This profile will not be suggested to other Client(s) if it matches their job requirement(s).
          SHENZYN will not be sending any jobs to a profile in case it’s private. However, if the owner of a
          private profile invites the candidate online to provide details for a job, in that case owner may be
          able to see all available jobs. Also, in case the candidate chooses to search for other available
          opportunities on SHENZYN, She will be allowed to do so. In case the candidate applies for a job
          posted by another employer, a public version of profile will automatically be created for the said
                    JS.</p>
      <p> A profile uploaded in shared mode will be suggested to other Client(s) in case it matches their
          requirements. A shared profile will also receive job recommendations from SHENZYN and will be
                    prompted to apply for other jobs if the JS logs-in to SHENZYN.</p>


      <p> A profile uploaded in shared mode will be suggested to other Client(s) in case it matches their
          requirements. A shared profile will also receive job recommendations from SHENZYN and will be
                    prompted to apply for other jobs if the JS logs-in to SHENZYN.</p>

      <p> The same profile could be uploaded as shared and private by different Client(s). If a shared
          instance exists for a profile, SHENZYN will treat that profile as a shared profile and will be
                    sharing relevant job opportunities with the candidate.</p>

      <p> Different versions of the profile can be uploaded by different Client(s) and they will be stored
          separately. However, if the JS logs in to review and update his/her profile, that version will be
          considered as the master profile and all other instances of the profile will get updated with this
                    information.</p>

      <p> Any profile uploaded by Client(s) to be considered for a recruitment events/job(s) through SHENZYN 
          platform will be stored in Shenzyn databases</p>

      <p> <b>2</b> Send e-mails/SMS to JSs. Employer(s) can send templated communication to JSs to complete
          actions like applying for a job, updating profile information and uploading their resume etc.
          Employer(s) will be able to track if the JS opened the e-mail or not, or if the JS has completed the
          desired action or not. All of these communications will be sent out on behalf of the employer and
                    will be triggered by the employer; however, the sender ID will be SHENZYNs.</p>

      <p> <b>3</b> Manage candidates for a job on an application tracking system.</p>

      <p> <b>4</b> Rate profiles and record feedback</p>


      <p> <b>5</b> Submit the profiles with client and receive feedback i.e. Accept or Reject</p>


      <p> <b>6</b> Bookmark/Tag profiles for using later</p>

      <p><b>Dispute Resolution and Jurisdiction:</b>All disputes/differences of any Employer with regards SHENZYN
          and/or the Services, shall be subject to the laws of the Republic of India and the exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the courts at New Delhi only.</p>
